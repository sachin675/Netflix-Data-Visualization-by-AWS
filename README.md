# 🎬 AWS QuickSight Project – Netflix Data Visualization

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Amazon QuickSight** with **Amazon S3** to visualize Netflix’s dataset.  
We stored the dataset and `manifest.json` file in S3, connected QuickSight to it, and built interactive dashboards for analyzing trends in Netflix content.  

The goal was to practice **cloud-based data analytics** and learn how QuickSight can turn raw CSV data into actionable insights with minimal setup.

- Connect QuickSight to S3 for seamless data ingestion.
- Create visualizations (charts, filters, dashboards) to analyze Netflix titles.
- Export dashboards to **PDF reports** for easy sharing.
- Perform **data refreshes** to keep insights updated.
